## The principles :
- Single-responsibility principle
- Open-Closed principle
- Liskov substitution principle
- Interface segregation principle
- Dependency inversion principle
<br/>
<br/>

### Single Responsibility Principle
---
A class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change
```cpp
class Vehicle {
	public:
	int speed;
	Engine* engine;
	int mileage;
	void changeSpeed();
	void changeDirection();
	void repair();            // Violate SRP
}

// FIX
class Garage {
	public:
	void repair(Vehicle* vehicle);
}
```
<br/>
<br/>

### Open Closed Principle
---
Classes should be open for extension and closed to modification.
```cpp
class Garage {
	public:
	void repairLocal(Vehicle* vehicle);
	void repairBranded(Vehicle* vehicle); // Violate Open closed principle
}
// Addition of new tyep of repair will result into modfying the existing class.

//FIX
class Garage {
	public:
	virtual void rapair(Vehicle* vehicle) = 0;
}

class LocalGarage : public Garage {
	public:
	void repair(Vehicle* vehicle);  //Local repair
}

class BrandedGarage : public Garage {
	public:
	void repair(Vehicle* vehicle);  //Branded repair
}

```
<br/>
<br/>

### Liskov Substitution Principle
---
Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes
> Liskov Substitution Principle is an extension of the Open Close Principle and is violated when you have written code that throws “not implemented exceptions” or you hide methods in a derived class that have been marked as virtual in the base class.
```cpp
class Vehicle {
	public:
	virtual void changeGear();
}

class Scooti : public Vehicle {
	public:
	void changeGear(){
		throw("Not implemented"); //Violate Liskov substitution principle
	}
}

// FIX
class Vehicle {
}

class GearVehicle : public Vehicle {
	public:
	virtual void changeGear();
}

class NonGearVehicle : public Vehicle {
}

class Scooti : public NonGearVehicle {
}
```
<br/>
<br/>

### Interface Segregation Principle
---
Separating the interfaces
> The principle states that many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface. Clients should not be forced to implement a function they do no need.
```cpp
// FIX
class Vehicle { // Common Base Interface
}

class GearVehicle : public Vehicle { // Segregated Interface 1
	public:
	virtual void changeGear();
}

class NonGearVehicle : public Vehicle { // Segregated Interface 1
}

class Scooti : public NonGearVehicle { // Implement only what required
}
```
<br/>
<br/>

### LSP vs ISP
> LSP: The receiver must honor the contracts it promises.
ISP: The caller shouldn’t depend on more of the receiver’s interface than it needs.
Where they fit: If you apply the ISP, you use only a slice of the receiver’s full interface. But according to LSP, the receiver must still honor that slice. If you fail to apply ISP, there can be a temptation to violate LSP. Because “this method doesn’t matter, it won’t actually be called.”

Liskov Substitution addresses **Subtypes** design whereas Interface Segregation addresses **Basetypes** design.
<br/>
<br/>

### Dependency Inversion Principle
---
Our classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions

```cpp
class Vehicle {
}

class Car : public Vehicle {
}

class Garage {
public:
	void repair(Vehicle* vehicle); // depends on Vehicle interface rather then on Car
}
```
